Breast Cancer RiskAssessment Study Survey:

Details: The survey to estimate the breast cancer risk estimates the absolute 5 year risk and lifetime risk 
 of developing breast cancer. The data of their first-degree relatives having breast cancer gives a 
 better estimate of them developing the cancer in coming years. This file contains responses to 
 the various quantitative and qualitative questions asked. The responses to questions relating to 
 their personal medical history , their first degree relatives having cancer and so on are recorded 
 in this file. 
 
Motivation: The data collection need is driven by (questions)} the necessity to determine: if pregnancy-related factors like consuming diethylstilbestrol (DES) tablets to prevent miscarriage can increase the risk of invasive breast cancer in women? Do the presence of breast cancer in close relatives increase their chances of getting breast cancer in near future? Is there a relationship between having a child at an older age and an increased risk of breast cancer.

File Description: There are two folders. 

1. 01SurveyRiskAssessmentStudy_2021_CSV_File folder: The number 01 represents the version. This folder consists of two files. The first is the CSV file consisting of the responses obtained from the survey and second is the metadata file.
1.1. Main file is name is named as Responses.CSV and the metadata file is names as Metadata.pdf. The metadata file consists of detailed description related to the  study, data file(s), variables, categories, etc., that make up a complete dataset. The codebook may include a dataset’s record layout, list of variable names and labels, concepts, categories, cases, missing value codes, frequency counts, notes, universe statements, and so on. The metadata is captured using the DDI codebook metadata standard. The information in this metadata codebook is structured, machine-actionable, and usable by computer software and databases. 


2. 01SurveyRiskAssessmentStudy_2021_ARFF_File folder: 1. 01SurveyRiskAssessmentStudy_2021_ARFF_File folder: The number 01 represents the version. This folder consists of one file. The file is in Attribute-Relation File Format. The metadata consisting of the description of the variables is inbuilt in the file.  The ARFF file consists of the responses obtained from the survey.


Uses of this project: 
1. The project can be extended with additional questions to obtain more information about breast cancer
2. The project can be extended to obtain more information from other parts of the world (participants from various regions across the world).
